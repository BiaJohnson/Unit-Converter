# Unit-Converter - Python

This Python program was created for a small artisan chocolate company that exports products internationally. While product weights are recorded in **kilograms**, international orders often arrive in **pounds** and **ounces**. This tool simplifies conversions between different units of measurement for both **solids (weights)** and **liquids (volumes)**.

## Features
The program provides conversion for:
### Weight Measurements
**Kilograms → Pounds & Ounces**
**Pounds → Kilograms & Ounces**
**Ounces → Kilograms & Pounds**
### Liquid Measurements (Challenge Extension)
**Litres → Fluid Ounces, Pints, and Quarts**
**Fluid Ounces → Litres, Pints, and Quarts**
**Pints → Litres, Fluid Ounces, and Quarts**
**Quarts → Litres, Fluid Ounces, and Pints**

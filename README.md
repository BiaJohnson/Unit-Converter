# Unit-Converter - Python

You work for a small company that exports artisan chocolate. Although you measure your products in kilograms, you often get orders in both pounds and ounces. You have decided that rather than have to look up conversions all the time, you could use Python code to take inputs to make conversions between the different units of measurement.

You will write three blocks of code. The first will convert kilograms to pounds and ounces. The second will convert pounds to kilograms and ounces. The third will convert ounces to kilograms and pounds.

The conversions are as follows:

1 kilogram = 35.274 ounces

1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds

1 pound = 0.453592 kilograms

1 pound = 16 ounces

1 ounce = 0.0283 kilograms

1 ounce = 0.0625 pounds

Challenge: The company has extended its product range to include top-of-the-range sparkling beverages that can also be bought wholesale. Extend your code to include conversions for liquid measurements such as fluid ounces, litres, pints, and quarts.
